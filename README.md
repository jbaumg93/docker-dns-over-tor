# Docker DNS over Tor üê≥

This small project lets you forward your DNS request over Tor. It supports DNS over UDP and TCP and uses Docker's healthcheck feature.

It utilizes [Cloudflare's _DNS over Tor_](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/fun-stuff/dns-over-tor/) service to resolve DNS requests. The reason for this is that Tor's option `DNSPort` only [supports A, AAAA, and PTR requests](https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en).
